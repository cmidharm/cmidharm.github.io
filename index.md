I am currently an AARMS Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/), Halifax, Canada. 
My mentor is Professor [Sara Faridi] (https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/).
Prior to this, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/), India. 

I completed my PhD at the  [Chennai Mathematical Insitute](https://www.cmi.ac.in) in Chennai, India, under the supervision of Professor [Manoj Kummini](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=mkummini).
My [PhD thesis](https://libarchive.cmi.ac.in/theses/dharmveer_math2023.pdf) is on the graded minimal free resolution of Hibi rings and Hilbert series of algebras associated to polyominoes.
I received my master's degree (MSc in Mathematics) from [Chennai Mathematical Insitute](https://www.cmi.ac.in), Chennai, India.

My mathematical interests broadly include Commutative Algebra and Combinatorics. I utilize the tools of combinatorics to study the fundamental structure of algebraic objects.
